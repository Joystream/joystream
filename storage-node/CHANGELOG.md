### 3.1.1

- `@joystream/types` dependency version bump for consistency with mainnet release versioning

### 3.1.0

- Adds connected query-node's state information to the `/status` endpoint.
- Refactors `QueryNodeApi` initialization (single instance instead of multiple ones) to have persistent apollo client caching, since previously a new client was being initialized for each request leading to entirely new cache object every time.

### 3.0.1

- **FIX** `getAllAssignedDataObjects`: The query to get all assigned objects during sync has been refactored into smaller queries. Each query will now provide no more than 1000 storage bag ids in the input to avoid hitting the request size limit (see: https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/4615).
- Improved error logging for Apollo GraphQL request errors.

### 3.0.0

- **Carthage/Mainnet release:** Breaking change for files upload endpoint, the parameters except the file itself i.e., `dataObjectId`, `storageBucketId` and `bagId` are removed from the request body and are now part of the query string. This allows the pre-validation of the request params to validate the request before the complete file is uploaded successfully,
- API request/response types are now autogenerated from the openapi schema,
- Autogenerated API client library (`@joystream/storage-node-client`) is now part of the storage node codebase.
