# Query node

This is a query-node project generated by `hydra-cli`. Experiment by modifying `schema.graphql` and the mappings in the `mappings` folder, defined in `manifest.yml`.

For more information about Hydra see: https://dzhelezov.gitbook.io/hydra/

## 1. Building the node

Run

```bash
# Make sure these steps are executed first:
# yarn build:packages; # OR:
# yarn && yarn workspace @joystream/types build && yarn workspace @joystream/metadata-protobuf build
yarn workspace query-node-root build
```

This will generate event decorations for the mappings via `hydra-typegen` inside `mappings/generated` (based on the runtime metadata saved in `../chain-metadata.json`) and a graphql-server along with the TypeORM models based on `schema.graphql` inside `generated/graphql-server`.

## 2. Building the mappings

In order to re-build the mappings only, without re-generating the graphql-server code and event decorations (in case there were no changes in the runtime and `schema.graphql`) you can also run:

```bash
yarn workspace query-node-mappings build
```

## 3. Initializing the database and starting the node

```bash
yarn workspace query-node-root start
```

This script script will:
- Bring up `joystream-node` service (if not already started)
- Bring up `db` service (query node is using a PostgreSQL database to store the data)
- Configure the database (`yarn workspace query-node config:dev`)
- Create the database and initialize schema (`yarn workspace query-node-root db:prepare && yarn workspace query-node-root db:processor:migrate`)
- Start the GraphQL server service (`docker-compose up -d graphql-server`)
- Start the Hydra Processor responsible for processing the runtime events and running the mappings' functions (`docker-compose up -d processor`)

## 4. Stopping the node and removing all associated containers

You can stop the query-node and remove all associated docker containers without affecting any other services by running:

```bash
yarn workspace query-node-root kill
```

- Database connection settings: DB_NAME, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASS
- Chain RPC endpoint: WS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT_URI
- If non-standard types are being used by the Substrate runtime, map type definitions in the json format as an external volume

## GraphQL Playground assets url
Query node's user interface, GraphQL Playground, is expecting to be served at `/graphql`. 
If you are serving the files on path like `/query/server/graphql` via some nginx proxy, aliasing, etc. you will need to provide
the base url to query node server via `GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND_CDN` environment variable.

```
# use the following when serving playground at `/query/server/graphql`
GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND_CDN="query/server" yarn workspace query-node-root query-node:start:dev 
```
## Development

Run integration tests
```
./query-node/run-tests.sh
```

To run tests and keep services alive for further inspection, set `DEBUG` shell variable to any true-ish value.
```
DEBUG=true ./query-node/run-tests.sh
```
You can then use queries manually in GraphQL Playground (http://localhost:8081/graphql),
see docker logs (e.g. `docker logs processor`), etc.

After running tests in debug mode, you can run more testing scenarios or repeat some.
This assumes the scenario is repeatable and any previous test errors didn't break
the blockchain or processor state in a critical way.
```
DEBUG=true ./query-node/run-tests.sh # run tests first and make sure services stay alive
REUSE_KEYS=true yarn workspace network-tests run-test-scenario content-directory
```

Commenting out some of the scenario's flow calls in `network-tests/src/scenarios/content-directory.ts` is not relevant to the current
scope of development or debugging might speed out the process.

### Processor setups
**Running processor with local Joystream node and local indexer.**
It's useful when you want to interact with Joystream node via Pioneer or Atlas and want to check results
processed by the processor.
```
docker-compose up -d joystream-node indexer hydra-indexer-gateway processor

# start the GraphQL server and Playground if needed via
docker-compose up -d graphql-server
```

**Running processor with remote Joystream node and local indexer.**
It's useful when you want to synchronize the indexer and processor with Joystream node hosted remotely from scratch.
You can analyze any errors in docker logs and tweak mappings.
```
JOYSTREAM_NODE_WS=wss://target-domain.tmp/ws-rpc docker-compose up -d indexer hydra-indexer-gateway processor
```

**Running processor with remote Joystream node and remote indexer.**
When debugging an error that happened in processor mappings on a remote server that has its own indexer, you can use it
and skip potentially time-consuming indexer synchronization
```
PROCESSOR_INDEXER_GATEWAY=https://target-domain.tmp/query-node/indexer/graphql docker-compose up -d processor
```

### Restart processor from the beginning
When debugging an error in mappings that breaks the state and processor needs to be restarted
and mappings processed from the beginning, use the following commands.

An example of such error is missed event creating a `Member` in block `123` and processing block `234`
when the said `Member` created a forum post trying to create. The only way to create a missing `Member`
is to start processing events all over.

```
docker-compose stop graphql-server # ensure graphql server is disconnected from db
docker-compose rm -vfs processor # turn off processor
WARTHOG_DB_OVERRIDE=true yarn workspace query-node-root db:reset # reset processor database
docker-compose up -d processor # start processor again
```

### Debugging Hydra errors
In situations when an error inside of Hydra occurs but it's not clear what event caused the issue,
it might help to add `console.log(nextBlock.events)` to
`node_modules/@joystream/hydra-processor/lib/process/MappingsProcessor.js`'s `processBlock` function
to see what events are being processed.
