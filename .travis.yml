# Caching of the runtime .wasm blob poses a problem.
# See: https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/466
# Always starting with a clean slate is probably better, it allows us to ensure
# the WASM runtime is always rebuilt. It also allows us to detect when certain upstream dependencies
# sometimes break the build. When cache is enabled do not use the produced WASM build.
# This also means the binary should not be used to produce the final chainspec file (because the same
# one is embedded in the binary)
