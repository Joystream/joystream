        "Now, as part of the KPI, you are asked to deal with incoming proposals, and open discussions in the forum. A proper discussion module has already been built, but it's not part of the UI yet. Therefore, the forum will act as a placeholder in the meantime.\n\nJsgenesis will make proposals from time to time, but the idea is for the community themselves to make them. Some things that needs to be taken care of:\n\n#### Storage Provider Parameters:\nThese were set to a low number, and with low pay. \n- How many does the platform need? \n- How much should they earn?\n- How much should they stake?\n- etc.\n\nUp to you.\n\n#### Set Curator Lead\nCurrently, the lead is part of the Jsgenesis team, but this needs to be rectified, as we will not hire anyone.\n- Who should be the lead?\n- Why?\n\nUp to you.\n\n#### Action\nTo make everyone a little richer, feel free to slash me :D\n\nIf this proposal was made by anyone else, I hope you instead discuss it, and vote in a timely and fair manner."

      "description": "Although the new incentive scheme has, in our view, been an improvement overall, the `Validator` role has not worked out the way we expected. As the validators simply aren't rewarded enough to cover costs, we're proposing some ways of increasing it.\n\nIt's become clear that most users are not familiar with how the validators rewards works, and how it's calculated. For some context on what is being proposed and why, go [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/validators#rewards).\n\nThere are many ways of increasing the rewards, but a good place to start would be to increase the `slotsStake`. The first attempt of doing so was to create more competition for the open slots, as seen in [KPI #5.2](https://blog.joystream.org/constantinople-kpis/#five). The Council lowered the amount of slots from 20 to 12 through [proposal #25](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/25), but the effects were rather small.",

        "Increase the `slotStake` by doubling all `validator` rewards for a week.\n\nJsgenesis will manually double the rewards paid out to validators for the next 100800 blocks (7 days) from the time this proposal is executed. The extra rewards will not be minted, but rather come from our backup stash, and not decrease the value of tJOY.\n\nAlthough this seems like only a short term fix, if this results in doubling the `slotStake`, and users keep validating/nominating after the end of the period, the actual rewards will remain twice as high afterwards. \n\nAs seen in the link explainer link above, the LOWEST stake of the validators are the easiest way to achieve increased rewards. Conveniently, if you want to earn more tokens by nominating, you will earn more tokens by nominating the active validator(s) with the lowest stake (all else being equal)."

We are currently not having any active KPI's. And rewards could probably be lowered. However even if we halve them it would still require refilling it every 4-6 days I believe. You are correct, currently there isn't much to do. But the role hiring was made during a KPI for content creation and there was a big spike in content creation that had to be curated. So that was our basis for the reward amount. If you feel like it's too much you can create a proposal and we can come to a mutual agreement!",

This means it's impossible to get the required votes. As we wanted the proposal to pass within reasonable hours in Europe somewhere between the 27th and 29th of July, we are requesting permission from the council to step around the governance process.",

Secondary effects of this is that some new proposals (regarding hiring and firing of the storage lead and a storage mint replinishment) and removing some old ones regarding storage providers.\n\nThis requires some attention, in particular the following tasks must be performed by us:\n- update hosted pioneer\n- migrate the content directory\n- deploy temporary storage-nodes\n- support\n\nWe therefore ask for permission to deploy the new runtime on the 29th of July 2020, somewhere between 1300 and 1500 GMT (roughly between blocks 1913800 and 1915000).\nTo sweeten the deal, we will add another $250 to the pool if accepted!"

There is one proposal bot bug also (proposal with grace period).\nHence I want to request about $350 for this work.\nI am using current exchange rate from https://www.joystream.org/testnet/: $0.0000403 per tJoy\nSo I would like to request about 350/0.0000403 = 8,684,863 tJoy\nThe max spending proposal token request is 2000000, So I will make 5 proposals for this\nThank you\n",

      "description": "After 11 weeks of KPIs, we at Jsgenesis are of the impression it's not working the way we had hoped. Though there are many smaller issues that may have contributed to the failure of the current system, we think the biggest problem is simply that incentives for KPIs are not calibrated correctly.\n\nAs the KPIs reward all token holders based on their proportional share of the tJOY issuance, it would only makes financial sense for true \"whales\" to participate, without a substantially larger fiat pool. Even then, the \"free-rider problem\" could come in to play.\n\nOur hope was that these issues would be mitigated through funding proposals and competition for Council spots, but that has proved to be incorrect.\n\nOur main objective for the KPI system continues to be attracting and training contributors to the project, while simulating the economic system we envision the mainnet platform will run on. At this stage, all improvements to the platform (in the form of development, marketing, content creation etc.) will need to be funded and executed by the platform independently.\n\nIt is to serve this ultimate goal that we have suggested some enhancements to the KPI system.",

        "An executive summary of our proposal to improve the system are as follows:\n\n- KPIs will be split in to \"Council KPIs\" and \"Community KPIs\".\n- Council KPIs:\n  - These KPIs will typically focus on short terms goals, like network stability, platform operations and allocation of resources.\n  - They will always follow the Council term (i.e. they will last for seven days)\n  - The rewards for achieved Council KPIs will be distributed to the Council and their backers (voters) only.\n- Community KPIs:\n  - These KPIs will typically be producing a deliverable or performing some task for the community or Jsgenesis.\n  - These can be more long-term oriented, and require more work and some skills in a specific domain.\n  - The reward structure will work similar to todays KPI system, but with a clear workflow, and with Jsgenesis providing a guarantee for the contributors.\n- Both of these KPI types will require more involvement from the Council, thus requiring better incentives for them to be active.\n- Jsgenesis will take a more involved in the election cycle, to avoid complacency and \"free-riders\".\n\nMore details can be found [here](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/9). Questions and comments are welcome :)"

This is an important way to build reputation and credibility on the platform for the future. The Jsgenesis team has, and will always continue to, preserve the history of the forum as we make further runtime upgrades or new chain, in order to preserve this history. To further encourage such use of the forum to build social capital over time, we should encourage use of the forum over any other temporary platforms, such as Github. The profiles on Github are not even clearly bound to platform memberships. Now that we have the Telegram bot, and the forum surfaces recent activity more clearly, its also much better suited to play this role. Further use of the forum will help us to identify other improvements which will be needed for it to suit the needs of the community as we move forward.",

If we simply stick to that one thing for now, I think it could be done next week, but if we want to include some of the other changes mentioned [here](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/1121), it would take a little more time.\n\nRegarding your specific example @bedeho, those kinds of discussions would certainly be good to have on the forum.

I may adjust this based on token value but will create a proposal for this adjustment if its a significant change.\nMy duties will include:\n- Representing the council on the community repo\n- Creating threads for council reports + tokenomics reports\n- Creating threads for KPIs\n- Communicating via Telegram when proposals require votes or the council needs to perform certain actions\n\nThe council reports + tokenomics reports can still be created by other community members who can use spending proposals to fund the creation of these documents, I will just be managing them. If I create the actual proposals I may apply for funding for these.",

As time progresses we can improve this greatly, but as a start this budget is fairly simple.\n\n## Current Obligations\n* Council Member Payments\n\t* \t\n* Council roles\n\t* Council Members\n\t\t* 20k tokens per 3600 blocks for 57.6k blocks (currently 10 members)\n\t\t* 3.2 million tokens per council round\n\t* Council Secretary\n\t\t* 2 million tokens per council round\n* Potential KPI rewards\n\t* $550 total (does not include weekly replenishment)\n\t\t* 50% of this is $225 (5184331 tokens @ $0.0000434 exchange rate)\n\n## Budget overview\n* Obligations\n\t* 5200000 tokens\n* Available for spending proposals\n\t* 5184331 tokens\n* Total\n\t* 10384331 tokens"

This work only covers the council report aspect so is worth $100 to the network, I'm asking 1 million tokens for my work, which is about $44 at the current exchange rate.",

There is also CM participation added which should help the community better vote for CMs.\n\nI've also been working on a list of ways we can automate council reports in the future, currently I do the entire report manually using chainstate which is quite time consuming, I've collected several ways in which an automated report will work: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/18\n\nThe total reward for KPI 17.3 is $200, half of this is for the council report and the remaining half is for a tokenomics report. This work only covers the council report aspect so is worth $100 to the network, I'm asking 1 million tokens for my work, which is about $47 at the current exchange rate.",

        "## Chain parameters\n### Validators\nUpgrading to a more recent version of [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) forces some changes on the validator configuration. Others are made purposefully, in the hopes that this position will be more lucrative:\n\nThe major \"forced\" changes from the upgrade are that:\n\n- Instead of the least staked validator (`slotStake`) capping rewards, it is now the sum of total stakes of all validators+nominators.\n\nAs rewards are calculated based on the stake/issuance ratio, this should drastically increase rewards.\n\n- Payouts to validators are **not** paid automatically\n\nHowever, you have two weeks to claim your rewards, so if your forget for 15 days, you'll only \"lose\" a day. (Also, anyone can claim for anyone, so a nominator will not suffer if the validator forgets)\n\n- Slashing has changed\n\nIf less than 10% of the max allowed validators goes down in an `era` (1h), they will get booted, but not slashed.\nAlso, the magnitude of a slash is much lower, and capped at 7% for validators that simply drop, whereas we previously could see up to 40%. (Double signing, and trying to pass \"fake\" blocks can still see much higher slashes).\n\n**Min yearly inflation**\nFrom 2.5% to 5% -> Effectively doubling the baseline reward for validators.\n\n**Max yearly inflation**\nFrom 30% to 75% -> So they can earn a decent living :)\n\n**Ideal staking ratio**\nFrom 30% to 25% -> Meaning that rewards for the validators grows linearly from 5% (with 0% of issuance staked) to 75% (with 25% of issuance staked).\n\nCombined, these three should make being a validator significantly more profitable. Note that none of these values above can be changed by the Council, but a runtime upgrade will.\n\n**Max validators**\nFrom 12 to 20 -> This was reduced because of the `slotStake` problem. In time, we may want to see the council raise this further!\n\n### Forum max char\nFrom 1000 to 3000 -> Requested feature :D\n\n### Council\n\nThe council will get a lot more responsibilities. We will also be more involved in voting in the \"right\" candidates.\n\n**Council size**\nFrom 10 to 6 -> This will ensure the Council always has a large ratio of qualified members.\n\n**Council term**\nFrom 100800 blocks (7 days) to 201600 blocks (14 days) -> Giving them more time to address issues.\n\n## Other Changes\n\n**Council rewards**\n1. Recurring rewards from ~USD 15/term to ~USD 60/term\n2. KPI rewards go to CMs and those that voted for them only.\n\nWe are going to target making the max KPI rewards for the Council at ~USD 500 a term.\n\n*Example*\nCM_N is Council Member N\nV_N is Voter N\n**Note that Jsgenesis votes will not \"count\"**\n\n---\n\nSuppose:\n- CM_1:5k\n  - own:2k\n  - V_1:3k\n- CM_2:5k\n  - own:5k\n- CM_3:11k\n  - own:4k\n  - V_1:2.5k\n  - V_2:4.5k\nCM_4,5,6=CM_X\n- CM_X:3k\n  - own:3k\nTotal: 30k\n\nAt the end of their term, the KPI payout was USD300. Half of that is split equally (150/6=25), half is divided by stake.\n\n- CM_1: `(60+25+(150*2/30))=95`\n- CM_2: `(60+25+(150*5/30))=110`\n- CM_3: `(60+25+(150*4/30))=105`\n- CM_X: `(60+25+(150*3/30))=100`\n- V_1:  `150*(3+2.5)/30=27.5`\n- V_1:  `150*4.5/30=22.5`\n-> USD660\n\n---\n\nNote that the KPI rewards will be based on the exchange rate at the START of the Councils term.\nThe weekly \"Recurring Rewards\", will act as a constraint on the Councils budget. If they overspend, their KPI rewards will go down in value. Assuming the exchange rate drops 20%, the KPI reward of USD300 will instead be USD240.\n\nWhen a KPI is paid out (in tJOY), the equivalent amount will be added to the fiat pool.\n\n### Bounties\nWe are leaning towards using the term `Bounties` instead of `Community KPIs` as referred to previously.\nNevertheless:\n- the Council will manage them as part of their KPIs\n- the (potential) rewards will go the individual or group that performed the work\n- if the bounty pays USD50, and is approved by the Council, but Jsgenesis only grades it half complete (thus USD25), the Council will have the difference deducted from their KPI rewards."
