What this means for each part of the platform:\n\n## Balances\nThe following balances was migrated:\n  - all those associated with a membership `root` or `controller`\n  - all tokens staked for Council Members and their voters, but as \"free\" balance\n  - all tokens staked for (as \"free\" balance), and the balance of the \"role\" key of, active Content Curators and Storage Providers\n  - all tokens staked for Proposals\n  - all tokens staked for Validators and Nominators (although slashed tokens was deducted)\n- The `Total Issuance` at the snapshot was: 154289593 tJOY\n- The `Total Exported Issuance` was: 140539804 tJOY\n- \"Lost\" tokens: 13749789 tJOY\n\nIf some of your tokens was \"lost\" in the transfer, users were/are able to \"claim\" until the end September 2020.\n\n\n## Fiat Pool\n- The fiat pool was \"migrated\" in full\n- Recurring Replenishment will now be bi-weekly, in line with the Council Term\n\n## KPIs and Tokenomics\n- KPIs has been \"overhauled\".\n\nGo [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/tokenomics) for more information.\nMore on KPIs\n\n## Media\n- All channels migrated\n- All content migrated\n\n## Memberships\nAll memberships migrated\n\n## Working Groups\n\n### Content Curators\n- There are currently no Curators.\n- If needed, `sudo` will perform curation before a new Council and Curator group is established\n\n### Storage Providers\n- We have set a \"temporary\" Storage Provider\n- This is just to let users consume and upload Media before a new Council and Storage Working group is established\n\n## Council\n- We start without a Council\n- The `Term` is now ~14 days (201,600 blocks), including:\n   - `Announcing` ~2 days (28,800 blocks)\n   - `Voting` ~1 day (14,400 blocks)\n   - `Revealing` ~1 day (14,400 blocks)\n- The Council Members (CMs) will earn 18,500tJOY/3600 blocks\n- The CMs (and Voters) will share the Council KPIs\n- The Council will earn more, but also have more responsibilites\n- Jsgenesis will be a lot more involved in electing them\n\nGo [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/council-members) to learn more about the Council, and go [here](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/categories/25) to announce your candidacy :)\n\n## Proposals\n- Proposals was not migrated, but historical proposals can still be found [here](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/historical)\n\n## Forum\n- All posts/threads migrated\n- Forum sudo re-instated in line with this [historical proposal](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/historical/18)\n\n## Validators\n- Max slots increased to 20\n- Max (yearly) inflation increased from 30% -> 75%\n- Min (yearly) inflation increased from 2.5% -> 5%\n- Magnitude of `slashes` decreased significantly\n- We expect more stable software, so there should be fewer/less `slashes` due to node-malfunction\n- Due to a change in reward calculations, the ROI should increase by a lot\n- Validators need to claim their rewards manually\n\nMore info on Validating and Nominating can be found [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/validators#rewards).\n\n## Other\n- The Overview/Tokenomics page is not yet deployed, but will be in a couple of days\n- Council KPIs and Community Bounties will be published [here](https://www.joystream.org/testnet/) in good time before a Council has been elected.\n- The [telegram](https://t.me/JoyStreamOfficial) bot is down, as it didn't survive the new [types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@joystream/types)\n- Things I've forgotten to address, will be added as comments :)"

Now they are waiting. I think it's time to take them to the main team!",

The Jsgenesis storage provider (joystream_storage_member) is also hired, but this provider is not paid so does not influence anything.\n\n#### Payments\n* No storage provider payments were agreed on by the council via proposal, but it was discussed on the forum as being $15 per week for each provider (the lead runs a provider but is not paid separately for this): https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/120?replyIdx=4\n\n- The providers are currently paid 10,443 JOY/3600 blocks, at the current exchange rate ($0.0000505) this equals to $14.76 which appears to be an appropriate amount.\n\n#### HELIOS output\n```\nFound 4 staked providers\n== Live Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 3,\n    identity: 'QmRTVdhaoVqM8RNJKg7ySGoATV7pJ8iTB4EQ5bc1mRCbvD',\n    expiresIn: 14360,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 1,\n    identity: 'Qma6vjPepCpCW4aKmNmPxCpgAsd8xWfqmzXj4pnjQUaEcj',\n    expiresIn: 13953,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 4,\n    identity: 'QmZnvxStz7RrrNX1ivxAXVgMBpj9u4Mja1FjKo9UVXLDxH',\n    expiresIn: 14313,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 2,\n    identity: 'QmaFBgVyAktkrVYajT3Yb4iFwQvimBm5jg648nZPxW4y1o',\n    expiresIn: 14101,\n    expired: false\n  }\n]\n== Expired Providers\n []\n\n== Down Providers!\n []\n\nResolving live provider API Endpoints...\n4 -> https://computt.com/storage/\n3 -> https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/\n2 -> https://tpd111.me/\n1 -> https://rome-node-6.joystream.org/\n\nChecking API Endpoints are online\nhttps://rome-node-6.joystream.org/ - OK\nhttps://computt.com/storage/ - Request failed with status code 404\nhttps://tpd111.me/ - OK\nhttps://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/ - Request failed with status code 404\n```\n\n(Data directory output was removed because of length)\n\n```\nChecking available assets on providers (this can take some time)...\nprovider 1: has 114 out of 114\nprovider 2: has 114 out of 114\nprovider 4: has 0 out of 114\nprovider 3: has 0 out of 114\nDone in 98.26s.\n```\n\n#### Conclusions\n* This role took a long time to become live, this can be seen as both a combination of the council taking time to complete the hiring process, as well as the software being changed\n* 3 out of 3 hired storage providers (providers `2`, `3` and `4`) are not currently serving content\n- `Provider 2` returns `ERR_FAILED`\n- `Provider 3` returns `404`\n- `Provider 4` returns `404`"

The rewards for this are stated as `13923 JOY PER 3600 BLOCKS` which would equal to $19.68 at the current exchange rate of $0.0000505. This is above the $15 the council had agreed to by about 30% (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/5) but given the curator lead is currently not taking payments, it is inconsequential. \n\n#### Conclusion\n\n* Most of the work done by the Curator Role was completed in the previous testnet, there have not been enough uploads to show whether the role is being effectively run but overall it appears that it is being done fine right now."

A user should select a block number, put it in some formatted embed type such as :countdown:#98004931: and the forum would be able to render this to users as a human readable countdown to \nthat particular block, such as Block #98004931 (3d, 14h, 27m remaining). This could be a valuable tool for forum threads announcing events and runtime upgrades and give users a much better indication of when events will happen.\n- (For the forum) Another would be a way of having block heights have a timecode that shows on mouse hover action, the user would input a block such as :block:#36234194: and when a user does a mouseover they would get a localized timecode shown in their browser (ex. 14/09/2021, 06:13 AM\n- A tip bot for the Telegram channel. This could either be an upgrade to the previous bot, or be a separate bot.\n- Some way to capture historic exchange rate from https://status.joystream.org/status so that users can determine the exchange rate at a given blockheight and also have charts showing the exchange rate.\n- An API documentation. Not sure how would be the best way to do this, but new users interested in completing bounties have had lots of questions about the API and since there is no documentation about it all, it may be worthwhile to have this available in some form.\n"

If the updates have code, then it may take the council more time than is available to review, so the submitter will have to consider how long the proposal will be open for before expiring. For now there hasn't bee much use of this, but it will be something to consider for the future when there may be far more complicated code updates.\n\nThis would hopefully help to ensure there are not too many proposals submitted or a situation where proposals are submitted for very minor corrections."

I've increased my payment for this job from 2 million tokens to 2.25 million tokens given the amount of work it requires. On top of the payment for this role itself I've typically requested 1 million tokens for completing the council reports, but I've severely reduced this from 1 million tokens to 500k tokens for this task: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/30\n\nMy initial application from the old testnet: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/historical/55 - Salary: 2 million tokens per council round (which is now 2.25 million tokens per 2 weeks)\n\nI created a document which explains my workflow, and this is what I follow while being the council secretary (as best as I can): https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/33\n\nIn terms of availability, there may be 3-5 days this week in which I don't have as much time available for this role, but I will still hopefully be able to contribute the same way only limited to certain hours. If the council doesn't find this agreeable then I am happy for someone else to apply for this position. In the event someone else is hired, I am happy to give that person guidance on how to conduct this role.\n\nMy Github username: https://github.com/mochet",

The Jsgenesis storage provider (joystream_storage_member) is also hired, but this provider is not paid so does not influence anything.\n\n#### Payments\n* No storage provider payments were agreed on by the council via proposal, but it was discussed on the forum as being $15 per week for each provider (the lead runs a provider but is not paid separately for this): https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/120?replyIdx=4\n\n- The providers are currently paid 10,443 JOY/3600 blocks, at the current exchange rate ($0.0000505) this equals to $14.28 which appears to be an appropriate amount.\n\n* Lead payments are managed directly by the council, so can't be judged.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* Storage Mint capacity at block #581018 is `1336380`. So far there have been no situations where the mint has been empty, so this seems ok.\n\n#### HELIOS output\n```\n$ /root/joystream/node_modules/.bin/helios\nFound 4 staked providers\n\n== Live Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 3,\n    identity: 'QmRTVdhaoVqM8RNJKg7ySGoATV7pJ8iTB4EQ5bc1mRCbvD',\n    expiresIn: 14044,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 1,\n    identity: 'Qma6vjPepCpCW4aKmNmPxCpgAsd8xWfqmzXj4pnjQUaEcj',\n    expiresIn: 14104,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 4,\n    identity: 'QmZnvxStz7RrrNX1ivxAXVgMBpj9u4Mja1FjKo9UVXLDxH',\n    expiresIn: 14125,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 2,\n    identity: 'QmaFBgVyAktkrVYajT3Yb4iFwQvimBm5jg648nZPxW4y1o',\n    expiresIn: 14087,\n    expired: false\n  }\n]\n\n== Expired Providers\n []\n\n== Down Providers!\n []\n\nResolving live provider API Endpoints...\n2 -> https://tpd111.me/storage\n3 -> https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage\n1 -> https://rome-node-6.joystream.org/\n4 -> https://computt.com/storage/\n\nChecking API Endpoints are online\nhttps://rome-node-6.joystream.org/ - OK\nhttps://computt.com/storage/ - OK\nhttps://tpd111.me/storage - OK\nhttps://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage - OK\n\nData Directory has 119 assets\n```\n\n(Data directory is removed due to lenght, it showed 4/4 replication on all content)\n\n```\nChecking available assets on providers (this can take some time)...\nprovider 1: has 119 out of 119\nprovider 2: has 119 out of 119\nprovider 4: has 119 out of 119\nprovider 3: has 119 out of 119\nDone in 109.97s.\n```\n\n#### User Facing check\nThe user facing check is a simple check to see that this role is working from a user perspective, for this role that means if videos are loading as expected.\n\n* As a user, I was able to load 8 videos without issues from the following nodes. Loading and skipping seemed to work fine and the speed seemed good:\n\n* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5DTVY5BZgf8C4ALMAEXPAU6yDzruZia89QVR8t9U93XrHJ7P\n\n* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5FBA8yAaKJFLBv17ioCcK7pYqytQqghWVUY57TNMDzaCYBK3\n\n* https://rome-node-6.joystream.org/asset/v0/5HE3SUGEVeRqS7YQ1Sw8SWByUCcn4JVeR5reAkeajAnTurBQ\n\n* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5DrzGzSbn9PmVQxskREbi7xnqhawu6TTmAiywrzsfmp6fEt9\n\n* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5CGYQYAyN78opDxL2dUYDV1ufDK9zDkhDU7UfRRaFEjEoXmq\n\n* https://rome-node-6.joystream.org/asset/v0/5HUQtZk5YPDwYaHJK4WqK6GmxRopFYLjeQbSYniHunQWAwTA\n\n* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5D3naphUGSgbWMnpcDnmYvz4rp9FFEtjTjyJxQgrb8HouiDg\n\n* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5HE3SUGEVeRqS7YQ1Sw8SWByUCcn4JVeR5reAkeajAnTurBQ\n\n#### Conclusions\n* During the previous spot check for this role, no nodes were working properly, this was due to a documentation error with Caddy. This has been resolved and appears to be rectified.\n* It appears the storage role is being managed effectively, HELIOS reports are being posted, the mint is being filled, and all storage nodes appear to be active and working.\n* From a user perspective, content looks to be loading quickly and working as it should.\n"

Neither of these appear to have any moderation issues, however one of the videos is currently unplayable (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/media/videos/957)\n\n#### Payments\n\n* The Curator Lead should self manage their budget, at this time the Curator Lead has opted to not recieve payments (this was communicated on Telegram)\n\n* The Curator Lead has hired a worker as required.\n\n* The Curator Lead is currently paid `13923 JOY / 3600 blocks` This equals to about $18.92 per week. Which is slightly below the $20 the council had agreed to in the last budget by about -5.39% (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/25)\n\n* The Content Curator are currently paid `13923 JOY / 3600 blocks`. This equals to about $18.92 per week which is slightly above the $15 the council had agreed to by about 26% (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/5)\n\n* Overall the budget of the entire role (lead + workers) equals to about $37.84. The agreed budget is $35 so this is not a significant difference given the fluctuation of the token value.\n\n* The Curator role does not currently work the same as the storage role, meaning workers have to be fired and rehired to adjust budgets (this was communicated by the lead via Telegram). This is a current system limitation which means it is difficult to adjust the budget.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* The Curator mint currently contains `220,312` JOY. There doesn't seem to be any issues with mint capacity.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n* There haven't been a significant enough number of uploads to make any conclusions regarding this role.\n* The management of payments could be improved upon, but there are currently system limitations that make this more difficult than with other roles. The differences between agreed and current payments aren't significant."

Since we agree on payments for roles in USD mostly, some of the actual payments are higher/lower than they should be just because of the exchange rate changing. For example, the storage lead has an `agreed payment` of `$35 per week`, but this is currently an `actual payment` of `$35 per week`.\n\nWe can't control the exchange rate of the token, but we can change on what we agree certain values are in the budget which has to continuously be reviewed.

This could answer stuff like how long until the next election. Or how many active proposals there are.\n* Another nice function for the Telegram bot might be to automatically send a notification when mints reach a certain low level (say 150k tokens).\n* A small bounty for someone to create a thread on the forums that collects a bunch of free / open source tools for video conversion\n* A script (or improvement of the current validator page) which goes through the past n eras and breaks down how much each validator and nominator made, puts out ratios and helps to better explain what each validator is actually earning.\n* A small bounty for doing a review of storage provider and validator costs. The person doing it should put together what the current hardware requirements of each are (primarily the storage space, CPU cores and RAM requirements which they can ask current people doing these roles for) and a list of 5-10 different providers, and how much each charges."

In the next council session we could maybe look at changing other rewards but I think we need to see how validator rewards change or stabilize for a little while before taking action. The reason for this is that if Validator + Nominator stake reaches 25% the reward payouts will be significantly penalized and it should be expected that validators will self-manage how much they are staking to avoid being penalized for staking too much. It isn't possible to predict how this will happen because this is the first time the stake has reached such a high amount.\n\nAlthough we are exceeding the weekly replenishment amount of $300 by $19 this is not a huge amount and to reduce enough to be lower than $300 would require cutting $19 from the budget of the working + curator groups and I'm not sure its possible to reduce them further just yet."

              "Text": "### Storage Role Spot Check\n\nThis spot check was compiled on 02/12/2020 at about 1:00 PM UTC (blockheight ~#1,019,597)\n\n#### Previous Reports\n* 18/10/2020 - https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/22\n* 01/11/2020 - https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/33\n\n#### Council Requirements\n\nWhen hiring the Storage Lead the Council agreed on certain requirements (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/4):\n\n* Twice weekly HELIOS report on forums\n\n- The Storage Lead has mostly kept to making these update posts: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/139?replyIdx=2\n\n* Hire 3 providers (including lead)\n\n- The Storage Lead has hired 3 providers (including lead).\n\n#### Payments\n* No storage provider payments were agreed on by the council via proposal, but it was discussed on the forum as being $15 per week for each provider (the lead runs a provider but is not paid separately for this): https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/120?replyIdx=4\n\n- The providers are currently paid 10,443 JOY/3600 blocks, at the current exchange rate ($0.0000471) this equals to $13.77 which appears to be an appropriate amount.\n\n* Lead payments are managed directly by the council, so can't be judged.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* Storage Mint capacity at block #1,019,733 is `830,830`. So far there have been no situations where the mint has been empty, so this seems ok.\n\n#### HELIOS output\n```\nFound 3 staked providers\n\n== Live Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 3,\n    identity: 'QmRTVdhaoVqM8RNJKg7ySGoATV7pJ8iTB4EQ5bc1mRCbvD',\n    expiresIn: 13932,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 2,\n    identity: 'QmaFBgVyAktkrVYajT3Yb4iFwQvimBm5jg648nZPxW4y1o',\n    expiresIn: 14011,\n    expired: false\n  }\n]\n\n== Expired Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 4,\n    identity: 'QmZnvxStz7RrrNX1ivxAXVgMBpj9u4Mja1FjKo9UVXLDxH',\n    expiresIn: -13532,\n    expired: true\n  }\n]\n\n== Down Providers!\n []\n\nResolving live provider API Endpoints...\n3 -> https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage\n2 -> https://tpd111.me/storage\n\nChecking API Endpoints are online\nhttps://tpd111.me/storage - OK\nhttps://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage - OK\n\nData Directory has 123 assets\n```\n\n(Data directory is removed due to lenghth, it showed 3/3 replication on all content)\n\n```\nChecking available assets on providers (this can take some time)...\nprovider 2: has 123 out of 123\nprovider 3: has 123 out of 123\nDone in 120.43s.\n```\n\n\n#### User perspective check\nThis tests whether the role is working from the perspective of a Joystream user.\n\n* Video load failures (ERR_CONECTION_TIMED_OUT)\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5GPhGYaGumtdpFYowMHY15hsdZVZUyEUe2trgh2vq7zGcFKx\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5FBA8yAaKJFLBv17ioCcK7pYqytQqghWVUY57TNMDzaCYBK3\n* Video load success\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5GPhGYaGumtdpFYowMHY15hsdZVZUyEUe2trgh2vq7zGcFKx\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5FBA8yAaKJFLBv17ioCcK7pYqytQqghWVUY57TNMDzaCYBK3\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5HE3SUGEVeRqS7YQ1Sw8SWByUCcn4JVeR5reAkeajAnTurBQ\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5DrzGzSbn9PmVQxskREbi7xnqhawu6TTmAiywrzsfmp6fEt9\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5CGYQYAyN78opDxL2dUYDV1ufDK9zDkhDU7UfRRaFEjEoXmq\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5DTVY5BZgf8C4ALMAEXPAU6yDzruZia89QVR8t9U93XrHJ7P\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5FBA8yAaKJFLBv17ioCcK7pYqytQqghWVUY57TNMDzaCYBK3\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5HUQtZk5YPDwYaHJK4WqK6GmxRopFYLjeQbSYniHunQWAwTA\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5D3naphUGSgbWMnpcDnmYvz4rp9FFEtjTjyJxQgrb8HouiDg\n\n\n#### Conclusions\n* It appears the storage role is being managed effectively, HELIOS reports are being posted, the mint is being filled, and all storage nodes appear to be active and working.\n* From a user perspective, content looks to be loading quickly and working as it should.\n* One provider is down/expired and has been down for approximately 22 hours. This does not seem like an excessive amount of time.\n"

None of these appear to have any moderation issues, however one of the videos is currently unplayable (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/media/videos/957)\n* I wasn't able to locate any videos that were violating the rules and couldn't find any complaints made by users.\n\n#### Payments\n\n* The Curator Lead should self manage their budget\n\n* The Curator Lead has hired a worker as required.\n\n* The Curator Lead is currently paid `13923 JOY / 3600 blocks` This equals to about $18.36 per week. Which is slightly below the $14 the council had agreed to in the last budget (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/56)\n\n* The Content Curators are currently paid `13923 JOY / 3600 blocks`. This equals to about $18.36 per week which is slightly above the $14 the council had agreed in the last budget (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/56)\n\n* Overall the budget of the entire role (lead + workers) equals to about $36.72. The agreed budget is $28 so this is a bit above.\n\n* The Curator role does not currently work the same as the storage role, meaning workers have to be fired and rehired to adjust budgets (this was communicated by the lead via Telegram). This is a current system limitation which means it is difficult to adjust the budget.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* The Curator mint currently contains `443,080` JOY. There doesn't seem to be any issues with mint capacity.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n* There haven't been a significant enough number of uploads to make any conclusions regarding this role.\n* The management of payments could be improved upon, but there are currently system limitations that make this more difficult than with other roles. The differences between agreed and current payments aren't significant.\n* The curator working group helped to compile a list of content for transferring to the new system: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/151?replyIdx=15"

          "description": "## Intro\nAn external stats website is described in this github issue: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/50\nPart of the work for this has already been done: https://joystreamstats.live/\nThis bounty was partially described here: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/63\n\nThis is also similar to the landing page concept for Pioneer for which there are several github issues:\n* https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/485\n\n## Examples\n* The Joystream homepage has `Testnet Metrics` which shows interesting data about the platform: https://www.joystream.org/\n\n* The tokenomics page on Pioneer: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/tokenomics\n\n* Siacoin has a stats site: https://siastats.info/ \n\n## The Problem\nPart of the problem with the current UI (Pioneer) is that it is difficult to change, and there are some things that won't be possible until later on. Pioneer 2.0 is in development but this will take time to be launched.\n\nThe council does do council and tokenomics reports but since these are issued only twice a month they do not communicate trends very well.\n\nKeeping track of active proposals and using the current UI is fairly time consuming, we do have a Telegram bot but there is no way to look at things from a 'live' perspective.\n\nOn top of improving things for current users of the platform, this stats page would also hopefully be a valuable resource to show new users the level of activity on the platform.\n\n## The goal\nThe goal of this bounty is to create a simple stats website that can be built upon incrementally. The stats website already shows valuable information, for example\n* showing the number of hours each active proposal has left (which can be seen by hovering over the proposal)\n\n* letting users click active proposals and be taken directly to the proposal in question\n\n* showing validators member names (which helps to show who is running validators)\n\n* showing this and other information all on one single page and not requiring a user to go through different parts of Pioneer\n\nAn external stats website would run on top of a node and go through chain data to provide data in two ways:\n* Live data (ex. issuance, active proposals)\n\n* Parsed data (ex. old council sessions, historical issuance, historical mint levels)\n\nAn external stats website could be a valuable tool for a number of reasons including but not limited to:\n* Explaining tokenomics and value of the platform\n\n* Better clarifying how much nominators and validators are paid (currently Pioneer UI only shows how much an entire validator gets and there is no explanation of nominator payments)\n\n* Surfacing active proposals\n\n* Providing statistics on proposal types and other interesting information. Explaining to users how many proposals there are and how quickly the council works is a very valuable item to communicate.\n\n* Surfacing recent forum threads and posts that are very active\n\n* Showing trends in storage capacity\n",

This would be https://joystreamstats.live as is. - $250 US\n\n2. show basic historical tokenomics data (total issuance, burned amount, mints minted values) with some graphs so a user can see trends over time - $125 US\n\n3. show proposal statistics (average time to finalize, how much historic spending proposals are worth with a graph, number of proposals submitted with a graph etc) - $125 US\n\nThis is not an official bounty, which means that any spending proposals paid out would come from the fiat pool (currently valued at $9746.68). If Jsgenesis decides to make it an official bounty, then it would fall under the Jsgenesis bounty system described here: https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk/tree/master/roles/builders#community-bounties\n\nCurrently the hosting costs are covered by @tomato, but later on this can be addressed with spending proposals. The ownership of the domain itself is not being covered by this proposal, domain ownership is something we will have to work out later."

We also took the same action in the last council session: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/56\n\nSome reasoning:\n* KPI and bounty rewards are added to the KPI pool besides the weekly replenishment, it doesn't appear that all of these rewards or even payments for roles are frequently removed. This does allow us some buffer with the budget.\n\n* Although we are exceeding the weekly replenishment, it is not by a substantial amount.\n\n* Validator rewards are at a very high rate, but at the same time validators seem to be starting to remove stake in order to keep the total staked amount below 25%. I think it will require some time to see how this balances out as nominators also have some effect on this part of the platform.\n\n* It is difficult for the Curator working group to reduce rewards as it does not operate like a normal working group, this is being changed in the next testnet which is launching quite soon.\n\n* Given the current token valuation, the currently paid amounts are in some cases lower than what we have agreed. So reducing payments further would only help if we were to substantially reduce the budget. The current budget for working groups (curators + storage providers) is $74. In order to reduce this amount and fit it within the weekly replenishment it would have to be almost reduced in half, this is probably not sustainable if we want to keep the roles filled."

This equals to about $18.20 per week which is slightly above the $14 the council had agreed in the last budget (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/56)\n\n* Overall the budget of the entire role (lead + workers) equals to about $36.4. The agreed budget is $28 so this is a bit above.\n\n* The Curator role does not currently work the same as the storage role, meaning workers have to be fired and rehired to adjust budgets (this was communicated by the lead via Telegram). This is a current system limitation which means it is difficult to adjust the budget. In the next testnet this will change and the curator lead role will be managed in the same way the storage lead role is currently managed, meaning the council can create proposals to adjust the rewards for the lead and the lead themselves can manage payments to workers much more easily.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* The Curator mint currently contains `554464` JOY. There doesn't seem to be any issues with mint capacity.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n* There haven't been a significant enough number of uploads to make any conclusions regarding this role.\n* The management of payments could be improved upon, but there are currently system limitations that make this more difficult than with other roles. The differences between agreed and current payments aren't significant."

              "Text": "### Storage Role Spot Check\n\nThis spot check was compiled on 15/12/2020 at about 5:00 PM UTC (blockheight ~#1,207,538)\n\n#### Previous Reports\n* 18/10/2020 - https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/22\n* 01/11/2020 - https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/33\n* 02/12/2020 - https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/57\n\n#### Council Requirements\n\nWhen hiring the Storage Lead the Council agreed on certain requirements (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/4):\n\n* Twice weekly HELIOS report on forums\n\n- The Storage Lead has mostly kept to making these update posts: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/139?replyIdx=2\n\n* Hire 3 providers (including lead)\n\n- The Storage Lead has hired 3 providers (including lead).\n\n#### Payments\n* No storage provider payments were agreed on by the council via proposal, but it was discussed on the forum as being $15 per week for each provider (the lead runs a provider but is not paid separately for this): https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/120?replyIdx=4\n\n- The providers are currently paid `10,443 JOY/3600 blocks`, at the current exchange rate ($0.0000467) this equals to $13.65 which appears to be an appropriate amount.\n\n* Lead payments are managed directly by the council, so can't be judged.\n\n#### Mint Status\n\n* Storage Mint capacity at block #1,207,563 is `3,376,218`. So far there have been no situations where the mint has been empty, so this seems ok.\n\n#### HELIOS output\nHELIOS is a tool on the Joystream repo which can be used to check the status of storage providers and content replication: https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/storage-node/packages/helios\n\n```\nFound 3 staked providers\n\n== Live Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 3,\n    identity: 'QmRTVdhaoVqM8RNJKg7ySGoATV7pJ8iTB4EQ5bc1mRCbvD',\n    expiresIn: 14262,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 4,\n    identity: 'QmZnvxStz7RrrNX1ivxAXVgMBpj9u4Mja1FjKo9UVXLDxH',\n    expiresIn: 14034,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 2,\n    identity: 'QmaFBgVyAktkrVYajT3Yb4iFwQvimBm5jg648nZPxW4y1o',\n    expiresIn: 14244,\n    expired: false\n  }\n]\n\n== Expired Providers\n []\n\n== Down Providers!\n []\n\nResolving live provider API Endpoints...\n4 -> https://computt.com/storage/\n2 -> https://tpd111.me/storage\n3 -> https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage\n\nChecking API Endpoints are online\nhttps://computt.com/storage/ - OK\nhttps://tpd111.me/storage - OK\nhttps://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage - OK\n\n```\n\n(Data directory is removed due to length, it showed 3/3 replication on all content)\n\n```\nChecking available assets on providers (this can take some time)...\nprovider 3: has 126 out of 126\nprovider 4: has 126 out of 126\nprovider 2: has 126 out of 126\nDone in 137.76s.\n```\n\n\n#### User perspective check\nThis tests whether the role is working from the perspective of a Joystream user.\n`Video load success` means the video was briefly loaded, playback was skipped ahead and there were no problems with the content.\n\n* Video load success\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5GPhGYaGumtdpFYowMHY15hsdZVZUyEUe2trgh2vq7zGcFKx\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5FBA8yAaKJFLBv17ioCcK7pYqytQqghWVUY57TNMDzaCYBK3\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5DTVY5BZgf8C4ALMAEXPAU6yDzruZia89QVR8t9U93XrHJ7P\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5DDjNSdvjkaQmVaUykKRKBSK4yQo74d41QwTUeBTziKdwzbb\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5D2Ax3RGFvNJnwiWYN9dun6YEJJh8wjnMjuqkgWZqjV8RosB\n\t* https://tpd111.me/storage/asset/v0/5HZA5c5zVP7EADgvsXHorv2kbWTHNrsfNL7YRputciZWyyJ6\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5EZ9EkjibcD5zqPGANTJrW5W33dqxthsnxssHoRperoVydYY\n\t* https://computt.com/storage/asset/v0/5EuSfj3chmpTYKtr7qchnZPFxCYkj3aBoe3iH8DiumZV16tJ\n\t* https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage/asset/v0/5CiMMxzNQKN8xp7AnR7hBMsqqR7PtmraFvFyfxGF8cktjKoe\n\n\n#### Conclusions\n* It appears the storage role is being managed effectively, HELIOS reports are being posted, the mint is being filled, and all storage nodes appear to be active and working.\n* From a user perspective, content looks to be loading quickly and working as it should.\n"

Although this is just the first release, we hope it will showcase our ambitions to more casual users. More info will follow in the blogs and newsletters later this week.\n\nFinally, after we have gotten this approved, we may ask for permission to skip the grace period and perform the upgrade during the weekend to coincide with the change of the Council.",

          "description": "I did my best to deliver work outlined in proposal 68 however some data is not available to achieve all listed outcomes.\n\n- Part I: DONE and REWARDED with proposal 71\n> I propose that this bounty is split into the following milestones: 1. set up initial website (domain and the current UI). This would be https://joystreamstats.live as is. - $250 US\n\n\n- Part II:\n\n> show basic historical tokenomics data (total issuance, burned amount, mints minted values) with some graphs so a user can see trends over time - $125 US\n\nThe link below shows basic tokenomics like total issuance, burned amount and a graph for burned tokens over time. Additionally it features a browser for council reports hosted on github. On a separate page all votes for previous proposals are listed and broken down by council member and round:\n\nhttps://joystreamstats.live/councils\n\nThe proposals asks for the presentation of historic data. If this cannot be found on-chain or other sources hosted by Jsgeneses this task cannot be achieved without setting up a backend including a database. As mentioned in #50 in the future this might be delivered by a `query-node` in development, however the schedule and feature set at this point is vague.\n\nTo determine the `total mint` the sum of all rewards needs to be calculated: council, storage, curators, validators. This is not a trivial task and code relevant to this is layered in multiple files.\nAs the proposal mentions this data is available in pioneer but cannot be easily edited to customize views. Additionally for previous rounds, historic data needs to be available. For future rounds this can be done by setting up a hosted stats server to serve this data to the frontend. I would like to ask the council to create a proposal describing the wanted outcome in a bit more detail including a realistic cost estimate.\n\n\n- Part III:\n\n> show proposal statistics (average time to finalize,\n\nThis information including visualized voting time for all proposals is available here:\n\nhttps://joystreamstats.live/proposals\n\n> how much historic spending proposals are worth with a graph, number of proposals submitted with a graph etc) - $125 US\n\nThis information appears not to be accessible from the chain. Please give a hint where to retrieve this information from. If it is neccessary to decode the onchain code of spending proposals, please give a hint how this can be done.\n\n- Source Code\n\nThe source code is available on GH. A PR with the full source code and instructions to run the website will opened on approval. It includes type-safe components that can be reused independently. Please note that maintaining and refactoring code in the future requires time and should be considered in price calculations.",

          "description": "Currently we have 35 validators and 18 nominators. A validator makes about $17 a month which more than pays for a VPS capable of running a validator.\nMore than half of all validators have extremely high commission rates (90% or more), this means there being a nominator is not an attractive role, since these high commission validators will not pay out any tokens to nominators or pay a very small amount.\nI've made this proposal to increase the number of validators to 42, as this will hopefully make being a validator or nominator more competitive. \n",

This is an increase of ~10% from the last council term. The Validators and Nominators are self-managing and the council can't easily influence how much they make on the platform.\n* The token value is quite lower (0.0000437) compared to previous councils (0.0000475 - 0.0000518) (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/152)\n* Council Member payments are around $16-17 per week, on top of this they are paid a bonus for achieving KPIs, you can see the previous council payouts in this document: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/council-reports/alexandria-testnet/Alexandria-Council-Leaderboard.md\n* The council has issued 72 million tokens since Alexandria was launched (this is through spending proposals as well as council member payments)\n* A large amount of tokens have been redeemed for money, as can be seen in this chart (https://joystreamstats.live/tokenomics). Although burning does not directly affect the token valuation, it indirectly influences the amount of stake validators have and subsequently how much they make as well as in other small ways.\n\nI will not be on the next council, so if this proposal is rejected or isn't approved by then a new council member should create the appropriate proposals to make this budget active."

So far there have been no situations where the mint has been empty, so this seems ok.\n\n#### HELIOS output\nHELIOS is a tool on the Joystream repo which can be used to check the status of storage providers and content replication: https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/storage-node/packages/helios\n\n```\nFound 3 staked providers\n\n== Live Providers\n [\n  {\n    providerId: 3,\n    identity: 'QmRTVdhaoVqM8RNJKg7ySGoATV7pJ8iTB4EQ5bc1mRCbvD',\n    expiresIn: 14150,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 4,\n    identity: 'QmZnvxStz7RrrNX1ivxAXVgMBpj9u4Mja1FjKo9UVXLDxH',\n    expiresIn: 14046,\n    expired: false\n  },\n  {\n    providerId: 2,\n    identity: 'QmaFBgVyAktkrVYajT3Yb4iFwQvimBm5jg648nZPxW4y1o',\n    expiresIn: 14171,\n    expired: false\n  }\n]\n\n== Expired Providers\n []\n\n== Down Providers!\n []\n\nResolving live provider API Endpoints...\n4 -> https://computt.com/storage/\n3 -> https://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage\n2 -> https://tpd111.me/storage\n\nChecking API Endpoints are online\nhttps://computt.com/storage/ - OK\nhttps://tpd111.me/storage - OK\nhttps://joystreamnode1.cloudstorey.in/storage - OK\n```\n\n(Data directory is removed due to length, it showed 3/3 replication on all content)\n\n```\nChecking available assets on providers (this can take some time)...\nprovider 3: has 425 out of 425\nprovider 4: has 425 out of 425\nprovider 2: has 425 out of 425\nDone in 357.44s.\n```\n\n\n#### User perspective check\nThis tests whether the role is working from the perspective of a Joystream user.\n`Video load success` means the video was briefly loaded, playback was skipped ahead and there were no problems with the content.\n\n(Atlas does not currently load videos from the storage nodes directly due to some technical issue so cannot be judged)\n\n\n#### Conclusions\n* It appears the storage role is being managed effectively, HELIOS reports are being posted, the mint is being filled, and all storage nodes appear to be active and working.\n* It is not possible to judge this role for a user perspective due to a technical issue."

Unfortunately, no one in Jsgenesis reacted to this in time (proposals can only be vetoed by sudo during the `grace `) period.\n\nThe actual recipient was `5EUUcgTb6dngyVfFHkU4qvqqCaiavgNzncPnnb8WsNdspJZT`, an account that has not made a single extrinsic (nonce is 0) on the platform, as can by confirmed  either by adding the account as a contact, or:\n`chain state -> system -> account(5EUUcgTb6dngyVfFHkU4qvqqCaiavgNzncPnnb8WsNdspJZT)`\n\nThere are some ways to resolve this, but Jsgenesis proposes the following:\n\n1. Member [l1dev](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/members/l1dev) creates a new spending proposal, for the same amount.\n2. Jsgenesis uses the sudo key to burn the 5M tokens held by `5EUUcgTb6dngyVfFHkU4qvqqCaiavgNzncPnnb8WsNdspJZT`.\n3. Jsgenesis increases the council mint by 5M tokens.\n\nWe will note that 2. this is a rather extreme approach. On the one hand, we would not approve of this if the account had been used. On the other hand, this ensures that it can't be a double spend."

As much as possible, I would try to split the time the make sure there's equal representation between movies made before and after 1972, but would only upload movies that are either  in the public domain or have an open license.",

The underlying issue is that the storage provider`s DNS settings cause issues resolving the domain depending on location where requests are issued from.\n\nCurrently TTL is set to 1s which breaks DNS caching. This setting is very low and can only be useful when transferring a domain. For normal operation however it should be raised to at least 1 minute or better several hours.\n\nWithdrawing the proposal.",

          "description": "After increasing validator count from 45 to 80, reward dropped from 500 to 300 tJOY per validator hour (40%). Recently more nodes rushed into the game waiting to become validators, with currently more than 300 nodes and above 50 on the waiting list.\n\nIf the goal is to correct rewards to 500 tJOY per validatour hour (~15$/m), max_inflation: 1_500_000 would be sufficient for currently 90 slots at current issuance:\n310 M tJOY * 1.2 / (24*365.24) / 90 * 24*30 * 45.1 $ / M tJOY = 14.8 $.\n\nHowever during the last days node count more than tripled (from below 80 to >300). It is hard to predict correct numbers until the end of this term but 150 slots would be enough for today. Accounting for an increase of issued tokens by 10M during the next two weeks, `max_inflation: 2_000_000` assures constant rewards:\n320 M tJOY * 2 / (24*365.24) / 150 * 24*30 * 45.1 $ / M tJOY = 15.8 $\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this proposal to predict or limit growth of slots. Generally two parameters influence payout: amount issued and maximum inflation rate. At an inflation rate of 2 daily 1.7 M tokens are added (310 * (1 + 2 / (365.24))), or 14.6 M (9.8%) in two weeks (310 * (1 + 2 / (365.24)) **14).\nTo increase opportunities without risking lower rewards in the future it should be discussed, if instead of adjusting inflation rate keeping slot growth in line with existing inflation of 10% per two weeks is enough.\n\nTo leave some wiggle room for the council to adjust validator count in the future I propose `max_piece_count: 500`. However actual payout is still limited by the budget set by the council which is limited by the platform budget set by jsgenesis.\n\nIdeal stake is increased to allow for higher nominations since recently 25% are topped regularly. With 30% additional 16 M more can be staked.\n\nAfter approval a PR is to be created adjusting above parameters:\n- https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/blob/master/runtime/src/lib.rs#L289\n\nFor reference see:\n- https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/204\n- https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/community-contributions/miscellaneous_reports/Increase%20Validator%20Set%20Research.md\n\nPlease correct if any calculations are incorrect.",

Please note that this is for discussion only as of now, whereas an actual proposal will be made as soon as we have gotten some input.\n\nTL;DR\n- Allow the council more freedom in setting the Max Validator count, and number of Council Members\n- Leave Validator rewards untouched, despite possible increases in Validators effectively lowering the individual rewards, to make it less likely that \"whales\" will occupy multiple slots\n- Increase Unbonding time (for Validators), so that slashing of Validators becomes more of a threat\n- Increase the number of active proposals allowed at the same time\n- Increase the required stakes for proposals to avoid this remaining an issue\n\nLooking forward to see what the community thinks of this!"

TBD KPI 11.4\n- Increasing unbonding time to 1 month or a week: As long as bonded assets can`t be used for voting this seems unfavorable. If there`s elevated interest to slash validators this should be explained more.\n- Increasing proposal slots sounds like a good choice. As council member i see no issue handling 10 or 25 proposals at the same time. Being able to have multiple proposals on the same topic without fearing to block other proposals should increase the council`s ability to decide between offered options.\n- Increasing stakes for text and spending proposals by 100% makes it harder for new contributors. So far there was no issue with too many proposals, rather a lack of clarity about the process for some bounties.",

It goes without saying that Jsgenesis has failed plenty of in dealing with their side of this properly.\n\nIn any event, we want to improve the situation, as we believe this not only is trains the Council for getting work done in the future, but also trains the community in using proposals and github.

              "Text": "The intended workflow, from the Councils POV, is:\n\n1. Jsgenesis creates an issue in the [Community Repo](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo), explaining what the bounties is for, success events and their associated rewards, some restrictions/requirements, and how the final submission should be done and graded by Jsgenesis. This issue is meant for the Council first and foremost, and ideally, the person(s) attempting, or successfully manages, to solve the bounty need not even read this issue.\n2. The Council parses the issue, ask questions if need be, fills in the blanks/details, and creates a forum post about the Bounty. This post should cover:\n- All the details needed from the issue\n- The rules and format that applies, both from the issue, and any other information the Council sees fit to add\n- The expected workflow anyone attempting to solve the bounty must go through\n\n3. Update the `bounties-overview` in the Community Repo (table and json)\n4. Somewhat depending on the format, but once the community member(s) thinks the bounty is completed, they make their \"final\" spending proposal, and a (draft) PR to the community repo.\n5. Only once this has been reviewed and the spending proposal is approved by the Council, the PR will be made ready for review, and Council Secretary will request a review from Jsgenesis, along with a link to the approved spending proposal.\n\nIn many cases, this will be quite a lot of work for the Council, and it may make sense to assign bounty managers/admins to some bounties. This should (of course), be compensated for their role.\n\nTwo examples:\n- Bounty #10 will mean lots of uploads, meaning lots of review. In the bounty issue, Jsgenesis proposes a format where the Curators and an admin/manager finds a way to relieve some of the pressure on the Council. As this deals with video uploads, the Curators part of the work is already paid for, but the admin is not.\n- Bounty #8 is quite labour intensive, and Jsgenesis requests a closed format. This suggests that the Council sets some ground rules (eg. application process, milestones, etc), and a deadline for applications where anyone can request being assigned the bounty for some period of time. Once they have found a strong candidate, that person must deliver within the agreed time, and their submission must be reviewed. Except (perhaps) the initial step, this is most practical to have a single person responsible for."

          "description": "My suggestion to create a Wikipedia about Joystream was warmly received (https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/164)\nTherefore, I believe that this topic should be promoted further. And now I will offer a variant of how you can implement the Joystream wiki\n\nI see the implementation of the wiki with the participation of the entire Joystream community. And in order to accept as many uastnikovs as possible, you need to make a reward system. That is, a bounty campaign to create a Wiki.\nThe bounty campaign looks like this:\n\n\nDescription: The topics of the articles will be listed below. On these topics you should write a short post with an indication of the sources.\n\nTopics: 1. History of Joystream\n2. Features:\n2.1 Video\n2.2 Testnet\n2.3 Forum\n3. Censorship on the site\nNote: Posts must be unique! You can't copy the previous person's post and change a couple of sentences. The uniqueness must be at least 60%\nRewards: One best post of each category will be selected, and the user who wrote it will receive rewards in the form of - $ 12 in Joy tokens\n\n\nAs the site develops, it will be possible to supplement existing sections, as well as create new ones.\nIf you do not like my proposed sections, or want to offer your own-offer.\n\nThis bounty should be distributed separately for English and Russian speakers. That is, it will be divided into two full-fledged bounties.\n\nI have provided 6 sections (including subsections), for each article written in the section will pay$12. The amount allocated for these two bounties will be equal to $ 240 or 3404255 in Joy tokens (at the current rate of $0.0000423).",

The frontend uses Typescript flavored React .\n\nThe rewrite is nearly finished due to the generous help of freakstatic who wrote the council report generator and contributes code to parse block events and era data. Additionally oiclid offered help to redesign the whole page. Stay tuned!\n\nCurrently the most requested feature is the display of historic data for validators to supplement their FM reports. This will be available within hours, just in time for the recently ended scoring period.\n\nIf you have feature requests or are interested to join the team, please leave a message on the forum with your tg/discord handle:\nhttps://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/257\n\nNew features:\n- redesign the frontpage to show a better overview (#84)\n- add a navigation bar to all components (#84)\n- add modals for details on members and validators\n- add support for channels and existing media\n- collect info on amount of spending proposals (#82)\n- improved validator overview answering questions listed in (#63)\n- new reward chart to show development over time (#84)\n- add backend to cache data and reduce burden on the frontend\nThe results become visible once the new version is released. The currently planned release date is end of February 2021.\n\nAll referenced issues can be found here: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues",

One of those has already been funded via spending proposal #163. \n\nI believe I can safely say that these materials are well received by the community. \n\nSo, this spending proposal is to cover 13 new articles and 5 new YouTube videos aimed at Russian-speaking community members. \nNext stage is tokenomics. \n\n",

Details on what resources are available can be found at above location.\n\nThere are a lot of open questions raised in bounties and KPI which this database can help to answer. Feel free to reach out of you are interested in data visualization.\n\nThis is a great steps towards the (a bit overdue) frontend rework and other ideas like sprocket or alternative viewers.\n\nPlease share your ideas in the comments or use this forum thread:\nhttps://joystreamstats.live/forum/threads/257",

This should include the `memberId`, `entityId`, grading of each submissions and reward payouts. It should also include a total amount of tokens paid out for this bounty each week.\n\n* Grading process: The admin should base their grading on a variety of factors, including:\n\n\t* quality of video/audio\n\n\t* quality and accuracy of metadata (thumbnail, descriptions, release year)\n\n\t* quality of metadata for the channel (cover, avatar, title)\n\n\t* length of content\n\n\t* relevance to the platform (videos relating to cryptocurrency could be graded higher than )\n\n(The admin is expected to use these factors to create a simplified grading process that results in an end score that directly translates to a payout (example: A video scoring 7.5/10 would be entitled to a payout of $3.75, whereas a video scored at 10/10 would be entitled to a payout of $5)\n\n\n1. Users submit videos to the `Submission Thread`\n\n2. Curators need to approve videos and then the admin of this bounty can grade them\n\n3. The admin grades submitted videos in a `Grading thread` (they will need to make this thread)\n\n4. The admin then creates a `spending proposal` to reward graded videos (at up to $5/video and at the current exchange rate). Preferably this is done in a batch to avoid having too many `spending proposals`.\n\n\n### Application Process\n1. If this proposal is approved, a thread will be created for applications (or one may have already been created). Users interested in applying for this position can post an application in the thread. They should give a brief explanation of their skills and any particular special way they would tackle this role.\n\n2. The application thread will be continuously open, but 48h after this proposl is approved, any current council member can create a spending proposal, selecting an applicant and using their account as the payment destination and providing the reasoning for hiring said person.\n\n3. The first approved spending proposal is the person hired for this position.\n\n4. After that point they can create a spending proposal each week for payment.\n\n### Further details\n* The Council via approved text proposal can amend or change the responsibilities, payment terms and reporting requirements of this informal position at any time. This includes firing the person if needed.\n\n* If the user is no longer interested in doing the role, they can quit via the forum or proposal. Although not required, it would be good to know the reasoning for someone quitting the role as this helps the council to better develop their systems."

It seems like it fulfills all the bounty requirements and I've tried it and the performance seems quite good!\nThe only questions I have at this stage are:\n\n1. The bounty (https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/101) has $200 available for \"up to\" two participants, are you applying for this entire reward?\n\n2. What is the storage capacity of the nodes? I ask because depending on storage, these nodes may need upgrading in the future depending on the blockchain size (which seems to be more inconsistent over time, but is still increasing)\n\n3. If you ran this endpoint on a continuous basis, what budget would be required? This could be a separate text proposal and I guess would fall under informal roles. Besides server expenses this would obviously need to include a bit for continued management. The bounty states we have up to $200/month for endpoints without question but the council would need to agree on figures.",

I've begun looking a lot more into what `spending proposals` are reimbursed by Jsgenesis which is why the distinction is a bit important.\n\n@oiclid yes, if this proposal gets fully approved then there is still one more slot available. The second place has a reward of $100 and if agreed on there may be a continued position to run an endpoint.",

More then 2000 unique people requested tokens with the bot\nI noticed that some people tried to abuse bot and earn some free coins\nIn russian telegram chat I asked them but of course no one replied. They got arounf 1000 JOY. In is nothing, but still not very fair\nBecause of that, a new update was released. A small anti fraud was developed\nA pull request was made with this. Now all scammers are getting msg \"abuse detected\"\nI am requesting some amount of tokens because of this little fix and a half of this tokens will be send to bot faucet i guess\nWhat is more, I would like to suggest a mechanism that will link wallets of this people, and if it possible, lock their tokens (all they have), not sure if it is possible, need to get into it\nThx\nPs. Pull request is on github",

          "description": "As outlined in [proposal 162](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/162), we have now prepared a runtime upgrade that makes the following changes:\n- Max \"active proposal\": 5 -> 15\n- Proposal parameter changes (eg. the valid limits for proposal parameters):\n   - Set Validator Count: `MAX_VALIDATOR_COUNT_MAX` 100 -> 300\n   - Set Election Parameters: `CANDIDACY_LIMIT_MIN` 25 -> 50\n- Grace period for Runtime Upgrade: 72000 -> 28800\n\nFor these three proposals only, `required_stake` increased by 5x.\n\nThe reason for lowering the grace period of the Runtime Upgrade is to avoid having to wait so long after they have been approved. We have had to upgrade by \"sudo\" to avoid both a long, and an unpredictable, waiting period. As with previous runtime upgrades, we are asking not only to approve this change, but also triggering it manually - at noon UTC the day after the proposal is approved.\n\nSee this [PR](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/2209) for full changelog!",

                  "text": "For the future it would be great to know how the council can verify the wasm hash and relate it to the code in the PR (or create a runtime upgrade) because in a mainnet scenario the runtime upgrade will come from the community or a technical team and the council needs the ability to review it. In this case the source can be trusted.\n\nOn the content:\n- the council had approved proposal 140, the PR (https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/2184) did not receive a response. It contained the proposal to raise ideal stake to 30% which has become more relevant recently https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/321\n- raising the unbonding period does not remedy the noted imbalance (`The uneven distribution may actually make it \"better\" if users are \"forced\" in to locking up their tokens for a longer time.`). The main consequence might be that staked tokens can`t be used for voting which makes voting more expensive until v2. Big nominators can still take advantage of low staked nodes.",

This can be verified by building the current master branch with docker :)\n- We discussed this a bit (both in previous points and internally), and opted against a \"half assed\" approach. I think you're right in that increasing this particular parameter would be an improvement, but we want to address the whole staking/rewards issue holistically.\n- Somewhat in opposition to the above, we decided that re-introducing the possibility of getting slashed outweighs the pros and cons wrt distribution…",

The entire process is contained in this PR: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/128\n\nBasic process:\n1. Users submit entries via PR and a thread on the forums. The first 10 users to submit valid entries get 150k each regardless of competition outcome.\n2. The voting process takes place on Discord\n3. Three winners are chosen based upon Discord votes and each of them gets a $100 payment (that is the amount this bounty pays out for this contest)\n4. One of the three winners may win more (this aspect is handled by Jsgenesis and described in the original GitHub issue).\n\nThis `spending proposal` is for 1.5m tokens, which will cover a payment of 150k each to the first 10 users who submit entries to this contest. This payment will go to the address 5GxjmW7qNNh4rTxpcrQgrNEzhdExMF3E6Kj11CogBqUmKYVA. \n\nThe original bounty GitHub issue: https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/89\n",

Then we will have 60$ (approximately 1,500,000 tokens) left to be distributed among all 10 participants.\n80$ is still a very good reward for this competition and I think no one will be offended.\nI think, while we can single out additional awards from the KPI awards, we should still stick to the agreed budgets whenever possible.\n\nIn addition, in the future, for such competitions, I would provide for a condition, based on which there could be not three winners, but two, or even one.\nFor example, for this competition, get more than 20% of the votes from the total.

This is explained in the new bounties processes and KPIs. I don't know if that request would be granted though, so the tokens can either be taken from the bounty pool or just as spending that isn't reimbursed.\n\nIn terms of voting on Discord, since this is the first time we'll be using it for this purpose, the system will be very simple but for sure in future competitions we can look at a more specific set of rules.",

They also need to keep track of how much is paid out.\n\n- Report / grade twice per week. This should include the date that payments are made, so that the council can keep track of how much the rewards for this bounty pays out to users.\n\n- Create a `spending proposal` once a week for their payments ($22/week)\n\n## Further Details\n\nThe Council via approved text proposal can amend or change the responsibilities, payment terms and reporting requirements of this informal position at any time. This includes firing the person if needed.\n\nIf the user is no longer interested in doing the role, they can quit via the forum or proposal. Although not required, it would be good to know the reasoning for someone quitting the role as this helps the council to better develop their systems.",

I've increased this to 3m tokens as the budget has increased for this KPI and the responsibilities have increased over time.\n\nI created a document which explains my workflow, and this is what I follow while being the council secretary (as best as I can): https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/33\n\nIn terms of availability, I may have other obligations and if there is any issue I'll communicate it.\n\nMy Github username: https://github.com/mochet",

All entities are mirrored on the back end and are sent in compact form (JSON) to the front end which is much faster than querying the chain directly.\n\nDo you have experience with bootstrap and how to produce pretty websites? I am happy to shift over some tokens.\nBugs sightings, questions, ideas welcome!",
