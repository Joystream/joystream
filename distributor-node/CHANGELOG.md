### 0.2.0

- **Carthage release:** Support for mime-type provided as part of `SubtitleMetadata` (video subtitles). It is now treated as fallback `mime-type` as long as it's a valid `text/*` type and the `file-type` package fails to detect any type from the file signature (magic number).
- **Security:** Sensitive information (like private keys) is now hidden in the node's logs.
- Requesting an asset which has not been accepted by any storage provider yet (`isAccepted == false`) now results in `404: Data object has not been uploaded yet` (previously `500: Failed to download object {id} from any availablable storage provider`)
- Fixed links in CLI docs
- Autogenerated API client library (`@joystream/distributor-node-client`) is now part of the distributor node codebase

### 0.1.2
- Fix cache `cache-control: max-age` header for objects served from the filesystem ([`send`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/send) library requires `max-age` to be provided as miliseconds) 

### 0.1.1
- Replace `read-chunk` dependency w/ custom `readFileChunk` implementation in order to fix the issue w/ data object `mime-type` detection (https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/3723)
- Add `version` property to `/status` endpoint result
