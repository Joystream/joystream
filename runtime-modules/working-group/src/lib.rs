//! # Working group module
//! Working group module for the Joystream platform. Version 1.
//! Contains abstract working group workflow.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The working group module provides working group workflow to use in different modules.
//! It contains extrinsics for the hiring workers, their roles lifecycle and stake management.
//! There is a possibility to hire a special worker - the leader of the working group.
//! Some module operations like 'increase_stake' can be invoked by the worker, others
//! like 'terminate_role' can be invoked by the leader only. The leader himself can be hired and
//! managed only by the council via proposals.
//!
//! Exact working group (eg.: forum working group) should create an instance of the Working group module.
//!
//! ## Supported extrinsics
//! ### Hiring flow
//!
//! - [add_opening](./struct.Module.html#method.add_opening) - Add an opening for a worker/lead role.
//! - [accept_applications](./struct.Module.html#method.accept_applications)- Begin accepting worker/lead applications.
//! - [begin_applicant_review](./struct.Module.html#method.begin_applicant_review) - Begin reviewing worker/lead applications.
//! - [fill_opening](./struct.Module.html#method.fill_opening) - Fill opening for worker/lead.
//! - [withdraw_application](./struct.Module.html#method.withdraw_application) - Withdraw the worker/lead application.
//! - [terminate_application](./struct.Module.html#method.terminate_application) - Terminate the worker/lead application.
//! - [apply_on_opening](./struct.Module.html#method.apply_on_opening) - Apply on a worker/lead opening.
//!
//! ### Roles lifecycle
//!
//! - [update_role_account](./struct.Module.html#method.update_role_account) -  Update the role account of the worker/lead.
//! - [update_reward_account](./struct.Module.html#method.update_reward_account) -  Update the reward account of the worker/lead.
//! - [update_reward_amount](./struct.Module.html#method.update_reward_amount) -  Update the reward amount of the worker/lead.
//! - [leave_role](./struct.Module.html#method.leave_role) - Leave the role by the active worker/lead.
//! - [terminate_role](./struct.Module.html#method.terminate_role) - Terminate the worker/lead role.
//! - [set_mint_capacity](./struct.Module.html#method.set_mint_capacity) -  Sets the capacity to enable working group budget.
//!
//! ### Stakes
//!
//! - [slash_stake](./struct.Module.html#method.slash_stake) - Slashes the worker/lead stake.
//! - [decrease_stake](./struct.Module.html#method.decrease_stake) - Decreases the worker/lead stake and returns the remainder to the worker _role_account_.
//! - [increase_stake](./struct.Module.html#method.increase_stake) - Increases the worker/lead stake.
