//! Council Elections Manager
//!
//! # Election Parameters:
//! We don't currently handle zero periods, zero council term, zero council size and candidacy
//! limit in any special way. The behaviour in such cases:
//!
//! - Setting any period to 0 will mean the election getting stuck in that stage, until force changing
//! the state.
//!
//! - Council Size of 0 - no limit to size of council, all applicants that move beyond
//! announcing stage would become council members, so effectively the candidacy limit will
//! be the size of the council, voting and revealing have no impact on final results.
//!
//! - If candidacy limit is zero and council size > 0, council_size number of applicants will reach the voting stage.
//! and become council members, voting will have no impact on final results.
//!
//! - If both candidacy limit and council size are zero then all applicant become council members
//! since no filtering occurs at end of announcing stage.
//!
//! We only guard against these edge cases in the [`set_election_parameters`] call.
