/// of `c` configured for BABE (where `1 - c` represents the probability of
/// a slot being empty).
/// This value is only used indirectly to define the unit constants below
/// that are expressed in blocks. The rest of the code should use
/// `SLOT_DURATION` instead (like the timestamp module for calculating the
/// minimum period).
