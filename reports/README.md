# Reports

Reports are documents describing the discussion and decision making that results from meetings which were not scheduled to have note taking, yet ended up being very significant in technical or organisational respects.

# Format

A report must include

- Title
- Participants
- Author.
- Time and place
- A description of major topics discussed
- A set of conclusions arrived at

Write in third person voice to keep report maximally neutral.

# Index

This is the index of past reports, they should all be stored in the `archive` subfolder under an integer file name.
