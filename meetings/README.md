# Meeting Archiving

Each meeting which will be archived has a _meeting identifier_, which is just a unique number, as seen in the template [below](#meeting-itinerary-archive-index). The itinerary, and any other related assets, for a meeting should be placed in a subdirectory of this directory with the same name as this identifier.

# Archive Index

This is the index of past meetings with itineraries, they should all be stored in this directory.

| Identifier       | Scheduled        | Status (`pending`,`done`) | [Type](../project-management/README.md#meeting-types) (`daily`, `monday`,`release`, `misc`)     | Link      |
