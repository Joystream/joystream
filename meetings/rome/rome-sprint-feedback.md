# Rome Sprint Feedback

## Introduction
As part of the `Tuesday all-hands` following our visit to London, it was decided that it would be extremely useful to collect feedback 
from the team on the perceived usefulness of the sprint for the purposes of optimizing our productivity during our next meetup and to assist with effective planning for this future event. 

The question below was posed before the brief meeting in Rocket.Chat:

```
This week, we should also include some thoughts on our London skirmish. Please prepare a quick summary
of your thoughts on:

- What did we do well?
- What could we have done better?
- When is the "right" time to hold a sprint?
- Other
```

`Ben` was assigned to take some brief summary notes in order to record team members' insights into the trip.

### Comments By Team Members

#### Martin
```
- Mostly satisfied with the progress made during the sprint.
- There was a lot of value in lots of the work conducted in smaller groups and one-on-one.
- Cross-communication was also very useful and was enabled by the physical nature of the meeting.
- Suggested that smaller gatherings are often better than larger ones (i.e. sprint) for productivity.
```

#### Paul
```
- Time spent programming etc. was not useful. Time should have been focussed on team/pair stuff only 
possible or made considerably easier by being together in the same room.
- Whiteboard time was very useful and could not be easily replicated using video conference etc.
- Wondered whether the trip was cost-effective.
- Most limited resource for Jsgenesis is "together time". This resource needs to be used effectively!
- Itinerary could have been better organized e.g. mealtimes.
```

#### Alex
```
- It would have been nicer to have a more comprehensive plan for the sprint.
- The above would have allowed for preparing in advance the things which could be shared with others.
```

#### Bedeho
```
- We (eventually) got to spend valuable time on problems that are easier solved toget: standing in front 
of a shared screen/whiteboard discussing design and data models.
- Would have been nice to have a clearer idea of what exactly makes sense to do when we are physically 
together. This avoid wasteful focus (e.g. writing tests), and also lots of time on planning.
- We should have avoided excessive focus on tracking progress, no fun, adds little value.
- We should have had daily "standup" at a specific time to help efficiently starting collabration each 
day.
- Best time for a sprint is perhaps super early in a release, or with more RnD/experimental focus, 
rather than tied to shipping.
```

#### Ben
```
- We didn't always stick to schedule.
- It was very good for morale for everyone to meet each other.
- Difficult to determine when is the best time to hold a meeting during a release cycle.
- Overall agendas should be flexible in order to accomodate changes.
- Really appreciated one-on-one teaching from Martin.
- Some conversations involved people who were not relevant to the topics discussed, wasting time.
