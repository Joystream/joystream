# Name
Rome

# Naming Rational
With `Sparta`, `Athens` and `Acropolis`, we have built a basic, but functional governance and media/content distribution system.

Rome is scheduled to be a larger release in terms of scope and with a longer release cycle. Thus it makes sense to "leave" ancient Greece, and move to another important location in the evolution of democratic principles and the rule of law.
