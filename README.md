# Joystream Runtime

The runtime is the code that defines the consensus rules of the Joystream protocol.
It is compiled to WASM and lives on chain. [Full nodes](https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream) execute the code's logic to validate transactions and blocks on the blockchain.

The joystream runtime builds on [substrate v1.0](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs) and adds additional functionality:

- [Council elections](src/governance/election.rs)
- [Runtime Upgrade proposal system](src/governance/proposals.rs)
- [User membership system](src/membership/)
- [Staked Roles](src/roles)
   - [Storage Provider](src/storage/)
- [Forum](https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-forum-module)
- [Discovery](src/discovery_service)

## Getting Started - Building the WASM runtime

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-runtime-joystream
cd substrate-runtime-joystream/

# Install Pre-requisits
./setup.sh

# Compile runtime
./build.sh
```

This produces the WASM "blob" output in:

`wasm/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/joystream_node_runtime_wasm.compact.wasm`

See deployment for notes on how to deploy this runtime on a live system.

## Deployment

Deploying the compiled runtime on a live system can be done in one of two ways:

1. Joystream runtime upgrade proposals which will be voted on by the council. When the Joystream platform is live, this will be the only way to upgrade the chain's runtime code.

2. During development and testnet phases, we can send an extrinsic (transaction signed with the sudo key) invoking `consensus::setCode()`. This can be done either from the UI/extrinsics app, or directly with an admin script.

## Running the tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Coding style

We use `rustfmt` to format the source code for consistency.

[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) can be installed with rustup:

```
rustup component add rustfmt
```

Running rustfmt can be applied to all source files recursing subfolders:

```
rustfmt src/*.*
```

## Reproducible Builds

In an attempt to have a reproducuble version of the runtime that can be verified independantly (by council members for example when deciding wether to vote in a runtime upgrade proposal) there is a `build-with-docker.sh` script which can be run to generate a `joystream_runtime.wasm` file to the current directory.
